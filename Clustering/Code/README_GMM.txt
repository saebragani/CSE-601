Copy the input file in the directory where the python file is saved.

In line 141 of the code, enter the name of the input file.

In line 145 of the code, enter the number of gaussian distributions (number of clusters).

In lines 148-150 you can overwrite the initial pi, mu, and sigma.

In lines 152-154 define the smoothing value, maximum iterations, and the convergence threshold.

Run the code, the log likelihood graph will be plotted.

Close the lo liklihood graph, the Rand index, Jacard coefficient, and the clustering graph will be output.
