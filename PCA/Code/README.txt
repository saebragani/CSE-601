1- To run the PCA code open the python code and at the buttom of the code change the value of the variable 'tmp' to 'a', 'b', or 'c' and run the code.
	The scatter plots will be generated for each input file.

2- To run the SVD code, open the SVD python code and change the value of variable 'tmp' to 'a', 'b', or 'c' and run the code.
	The scatter plots will be generated and can be compared with the results from PCA.

3- To run the tSNE code, open the tSNE python code and change the value of the variable 'tmp' to 'a', 'b', or 'c' and run the code.
	The code will generate the scatter plot for each file so that they can be compared against the PCA and SVD plots.
